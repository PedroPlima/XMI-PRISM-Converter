Astah UML XMI files transformed to DTMC via UnB-DALi

This project is to attempt to extract the information of an UML diagram in the form of an XMI file so that it can be used as input to the UnB-Dependability Analisys Library, that conducts the graph transformation of a UML diagram to a Discrete Time Markov Chain (DTMC) in the language of the PRISM model checker tool.
