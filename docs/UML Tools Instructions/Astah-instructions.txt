How to insert probabilities in your Astah's Diagrams

We assume that the user is familiar with the Astah UML tool.

The real number of the probability, p, is a number where 0.0 <= p <= 1.0

*Activity Diagrams*
To annotate the probability in your transitions:
	1. Select an edge.
	2. Select the tab "TaggedValue" and create a new TaggedValue by clicking on the "Add" button.
	3. Give a name ("p", or "PTS") and insert the probability real number, p, in the "Value" field.

*Sequence Diagrams*
To annotate the probability in your components:
	1. Select a lifeline.
	2. Select the tab "TaggedValue" and create a new TaggedValue by clicking on the "Add" button.
	3. Give a name ("p", or "BCompRel") and insert the probability real number, p, in the "Value" field.

*Exporting Diagram*
	1- Inside Astah Professional, with your opened project, click on Tools > XML Input & Output > Save as XML Project.
	2- Go to the folder where the project is and copy the generated XML file.
