How to insert probabilities in your Astah's Diagrams
We assume that the user is familiar with the Astah UML tool.

The real number of the probability, p, is a number where 0.0 <= p <= 1.0

*** Activity Diagrams ***
To annotate the probability in your transitions/control flows:
	1. Select a control flow.
	2. Select the tab "TaggedValue" and create a new TaggedValue by clicking on the "Add" button.
	3. Give a name ("p", or "PTS") and insert the probability real number, p, in the "Value" field.

*** Sequence Diagrams ***
To annotate the probability in your components/lifelines:
	1. Select a lifeline
	2. Select the tab "TaggedValue" and create a new TaggedValue by clicking on the "Add" button
	3. Give a name ("p", or "BCompRel") and insert the probability real number, p, in the "Value" field
